Hi!

# Introduction

This project explores and analyzes a database maintained by the Laboratory for Advancing Sustainable Critical Infrastructure at Purdue containing major power outage data in the continental U.S. from January 2000 to July 2016. 

As a foundation of the U.S.'s infrastructure, power grid failures have the potential to severely disrupt the lives and livelihoods of Americans; in particular, the last five years have seen a number of major failures. In 2021, Texas saw unexpected winter storm systems that overwhelmed their poorly-kept grid, which in conjunction with poor crisis management by lawmakers and power companies ended up affecting more than 4.5 million customers. I'm particularly interested in this dataset as a native Californian; PG&E is notorious for their mishandling of line maintenance and outage response. Not only California tend to experience more outages than most other states in the U.S., but downed PG&E lines have directly resulted in some of the most devastating wildfires in recent years. (This set of fires notably includes the Kincade Fire in Sonoma County and the Dixie Fire, which spanned more than 5 counties in Northern California and is California's second largest fire ever as of December 2024. 

Grid maintenance and outage responses are primarily the responsibility of private companies operated on a (largely) state-by-state basis, and I was therefore curious to explore the dataset and see how outages varied state-by-state and region-by-region. The database contains 1534 rows of data (each row representing an outage) and 57 columns, but I primarily looked at the following columns for the purposes of this report.
